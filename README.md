## Q1.
For the course project will create data storytelling videos using R (and possibly R Shiny) along with Adobe Premier Rush. You can choose to work individually or in groups of size two or three. The goal is something similar to the [Hans Rosling Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbkSRLYSojo?rel=0).

### a. (1 point)
Propose a dataset that you'd like to explore for the data storytelling project. You can still change this later if you'd like.

### b. (1 point)
State whether you intend to work in a group (if so, who) or alone for the project.

### c. Base R: Data Visualization (4 points)

Use the proposed dataset and base R graphics, to create a compelling graphic that adheres to the design principles from class. Make sure to include informative titles and axes labels. Include a short written paragraph to summarize the story your graphic displays.

### d. ggplot2: Data Visualization (4 points)

Use the proposed dataset and `ggplot2`  graphics, to create a compelling graphic that adheres to the design principles from class. Make sure to include informative titles and axes labels. Include a short written paragraph to summarize the story your graphic displays.


## Q2. Shiny (2 points)

Open the default Shiny Web App in R that contains the interactive histogram of Old faithful eruptions. Change the color of the histogram and reload the app. You can turn in a screenshot of the app or turn in the app.R file to generate the app.
